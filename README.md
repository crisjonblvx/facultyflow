## 🎓 Built For Educators

**Why FacultyFlow exists:**

CJ (the creator) is a Mass Communications professor at VUU who got tired of:
- Spending 40 hours building Canvas courses
- Paying $1,200/month for Moltbot (a scam)
- Watching colleagues struggle with the same problems

So he built FacultyFlow with Bonita AI to:
- Save educators time (25+ hours per course)
- Keep it affordable ($19-29/mo vs. $1,000+ alternatives)
- Preserve quality (AI-generated but human-reviewed)
- Support HBCUs and underfunded schools

**This is by educators, for educators.**

---

## 🦋 Powered by Bonita AI

**What is Bonita?**

Bonita is CJ's AI sovereignty stack that:
- Routes tasks to the best AI model (Claude/Qwen/Gemini)
- Saves 95% on AI costs vs. always using expensive models
- Preserves cultural identity and values
- Powers multiple products (FacultyFlow, heybonita.ai, BLVX, HBCU.news)

**FacultyFlow is the first product built on Bonita.**

More coming soon. 🚀
