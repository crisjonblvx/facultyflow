# ReadySetClass™ Logo Trademark Instructions

## Current Status
The logo files need the ™ trademark symbol added visually to the design.

## Files to Update
1. `ReadySetClass_alpha_full.png` - Full wordmark logo
2. `ReadySetClass_alpha_badge.png` - Badge/icon version

## How to Add ™ Symbol

### Design Specifications:
- **Symbol:** ™ (trademark symbol, NOT ®)
- **Position:** Top-right corner of the final "s" in "ReadySetClass"
- **Size:** 50-60% of the main text height
- **Color:** Navy blue (#1E3A5F) matching the text
- **Font:** Same as main logo font (clean sans-serif)
- **Alignment:** Superscript, optically aligned with cap height

### Visual Placement:
```
ReadySetClass™
             ↑
    Place ™ here (superscript)
```

### For the Badge Version:
If the badge is too small for legible ™:
- Use the badge without ™ in small contexts (favicons, app icons)
- Always use ™ when displaying full wordmark

## Where ™ Must Appear

### Always Use ™:
- Landing page headers
- Marketing materials
- Social media posts
- Email signatures
- Presentations
- Legal documents
- Website titles and headers

### Optional (Can Omit):
- Favicon (too small to read)
- App icon (too small to read)
- Inline text references after first mention on a page
- Alt text (use in meta descriptions instead)

## HTML/Text Usage

When referencing the brand name in text:
- First mention on each page: "ReadySetClass™"
- Subsequent mentions: Can drop ™ for readability
- Legal pages (Terms, Privacy): Always use ™

## Why ™ and Not ®?

- **™** = Trademark (common law rights, use immediately)
- **®** = Registered Trademark (only after USPTO registration)

We use ™ until we receive federal trademark registration from USPTO.

Once registered (6-12 months after filing), we'll switch to ®.

## Action Items

- [ ] Update `ReadySetClass_alpha_full.png` with ™
- [ ] Update `ReadySetClass_alpha_badge.png` with ™ (if space permits)
- [ ] Create separate "wordmark + ™" version for marketing
- [ ] Update brand guidelines with ™ usage rules
